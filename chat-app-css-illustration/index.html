    Samuel Green Available to Walk That sounds great. I’d be happy with that.
    Could you send over some pictures of your dog, please? Here are a few
    pictures. She’s a happy girl! Can you make it? She looks so happy! The time
    we discussed works. How long shall I take her out for? 30 minute walk $29 1
    hour walk $49 Type a message… Simple booking Stay in touch with our dog
    walkers through the chat interface. This makes it easy to discuss
    arrangements and make bookings. Once the walk has been completed you can
    rate your walker and book again all through the chat.
